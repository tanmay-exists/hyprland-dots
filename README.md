# **My Hyprland Dotfiles**

Welcome to my personal **Hyprland configurations** repository!  
These are my custom settings and configs, designed to fit my workflow.  
**Disclaimer:** I'm still learning 😭. These are *hardcoded* settings that work for me.  
Keeping them here as a backup, just in case I lose my way.
